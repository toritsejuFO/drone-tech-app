# Drone Tech App

Implementation of a Drone Tech App for the Drone Tech Inc. company.

### Caveats
1. We are storing the medication image directly on our local file system storage because we needed to make the app as self-enclosing as possible for this demo, to reduce external dependency. Ideally, we would store the url in our db and then the actual image blob on a blob storage like AWS S3 or Google Cloud Storage.
